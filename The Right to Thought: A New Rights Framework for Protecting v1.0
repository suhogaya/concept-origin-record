The Right to Thought: A New Rights Framework for Protecting
Cognitive Freedom in the AI Era
Abstract
The proliferation of large language models has ushered in an era where human thought processes are
collected and analyzed in unprecedented ways. This study analyzes the issues of cognitive data collection
and utilization that current personal information protection frameworks fail to capture, and proposes a
new rights concept called the 'Right to Thought.'
Research findings confirm that despite 'opt-out of training' settings, major AI services continue to access
users' conversational content under various justifications such as quality management, safety reviews, and
system optimization. In particular, there exists a possibility that creative ideas may be classified as
"meaningful conversations" and utilized for system improvements. This paper explicates such
mechanisms through Counter Display Theory, analyzed through a bifurcated framework distinguishing
between 'Cognitive Exposure' and 'Selective Value Assessment.'
Through empirical case analysis, we identified structural contradictions wherein the current system
paradoxically induces additional cognitive exposure during users' attempts to exercise their rights. Based
on these findings, we demonstrate the necessity of a new rights framework for protecting cognitive
sovereignty and propose directions for collaborative development with the AI industry.

1. Introduction
1.1 Research Background
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology is fundamentally transforming the modes of
interaction between humans and machines. Conversational AI services based on large language models
have acquired capabilities to capture and analyze human thought processes in real-time, transcending
mere information processing. This raises new dimensional problems that cannot be addressed by existing
personal information protection paradigms.
According to recent studies, wearable devices employing digital phenotyping can predict mental health
states with 87-89% accuracy, while the PersonaLLM research demonstrated that human evaluators could
recognize AI-inferred personality traits with 80% accuracy. This suggests that AI systems can successfully
extract information that users have not explicitly disclosed.
Currently, hundreds of millions of users worldwide routinely utilize AI services to perform tasks, engage in
creative activities, and solve problems. In this process, users share their most creative and innovativethoughts with AI systems. However, transparency regarding how this cognitive data is collected and
utilized remains insufficient.
1.2 Problem Statement
This study raises the following core issues:
Extant data protection frameworks concentrate on static personal information, thereby limiting their
capacity to safeguard dynamic thought processes and cognitive patterns. Personal information protection
laws are centered on identifiable information, and privacy rights are confined to the private sphere.
However, the flow of thought, problem-solving approaches, and creative ideation processes revealed in
interactions with AI fall outside the protective scope of these existing rights frameworks.
Second, a significant gap exists between AI services' data processing practices and users' expectations.
Many users believe that 'no training' settings completely protect their data, but in reality, data access and
analysis continue for various purposes.
Third, the boundaries between creative contributions and intellectual property are becoming blurred.
Who owns the ideas and insights generated in collaboration with AI? When users' innovative thinking is
utilized for AI system improvements, how should recognition and compensation be provided? These
questions demand a fundamental reconsideration of knowledge production and innovation in the AI era.
1.3 Research Purpose and Significance
This study aims to propose the 'Right to Thought' as a new rights framework for protecting cognitive
freedom in the AI era and to explore concrete measures for its realization. Through this, we intend to
make the following contributions:
Theoretically, we provide a systematic explanation of AI systems' cognitive collection mechanisms
through Counter Display Theory, presenting a more sophisticated analytical framework by distinguishing
between 'Cognitive Exposure' and 'Selective Value Assessment.' Empirically, we analyze the actual data
processing practices of major AI services and structural problems arising in users' exercise of rights.
Policy-wise, we propose a balanced governance direction that protects users' rights without hindering
innovation.
Above all, this study seeks to establish a foundation for constructive dialogue and cooperation between
the AI industry and users. The Right to Thought will serve not as regulation that hinders AI development,
but as a foundation for AI and humans to pursue sustainable innovation based on mutual trust.
2. Theoretical Background and Literature Review
2.1 Development and Limitations of Existing Rights Frameworks
2.1.1 Evolution of the Personal Information Protection ParadigmThe concept of personal information protection has continuously expanded with the advancement of the
information age. Initially centered on direct identification information such as names and social security
numbers, the scope has gradually expanded to include indirect identifiable information, sensitive
information, and pseudonymized information.
Korea's Personal Information Protection Act Article 2 defines personal information as "information
relating to a living individual that enables the identification of an individual through name, resident
registration number, images, etc.," while GDPR Article 4(1) defines it as "any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person." However, these definitions still focus on 'information' itself,
failing to adequately capture the dynamic and contextual characteristics of 'thought processes.'
2.1.2 Multilayered Understanding of Privacy Concepts
The privacy concept, beginning with Warren and Brandeis's classic definition of "the right to be let alone,"
has evolved into subdivisions including information privacy, decisional privacy, and bodily privacy.
However, cognitive exposure occurring in interactions with AI forms a new domain not clearly included in
these traditional classifications.
2.2 Prior Concepts Related to Cognitive Freedom
2.2.1 Cognitive Liberty
Bublitz and Merkel (2014) defined cognitive liberty as "self-determination over one's mental processes."
They primarily focused on direct brain intervention technologies such as neuropharmaceuticals and
brain-computer interfaces. Bayne and Levy (2019) expanded this to define it as "freedom to control one's
mental processes, cognition, and consciousness." However, these discussions do not adequately address
the issue of indirect and non-invasive cognitive data collection through AI.
2.2.2 Neuro-rights
The neuro-rights proposed by Yuste et al. (2017) include five rights: mental privacy, personal identity, free
will, fair access to mental augmentation, and protection from algorithmic bias. While Chile's 2021
constitutional inclusion of this concept provides an important precedent, it also focuses on direct
collection of brain data, insufficiently addressing the issue of indirect cognitive data collection through
language.
2.2.3 Data Sovereignty
Hummel et al. (2021) defined data sovereignty as "the ability of individuals to exercise substantial control
over their data." While this provides an important theoretical foundation for the Right to Thought, it does
not sufficiently consider the specificity of thought processes.
2.3 Interaction between AI Systems and Human Cognition
2.3.1 Operating Mechanisms of Conversational AIModern large language models demonstrate capabilities that transcend simple pattern matching,
exhibiting contextual understanding and reasoning abilities. While this enables deeper levels of cognitive
exchange in user interactions, it simultaneously allows for more sophisticated capture of users' thought
processes.
2.3.2 Process of Making Tacit Knowledge Explicit
The concept of tacit knowledge presented by Polanyi (1966) takes on new meaning in the context of AI
interaction. Users verbalize thought processes they may not have clearly recognized while conversing
with AI, which are then transformed into structured and analyzable forms by AI systems.
These theoretical foundations suggest the necessity of a new rights framework in the AI era. The
following chapter will explain the methodology adopted by this study based on this theoretical
background.
3. Research Methodology
3.1 Research Design
Based on the theoretical background examined above, this study adopted a mixed methodology
combining qualitative research and policy analysis. This approach aims to comprehensively understand
complex and multifaceted phenomena. Particularly, analyzing the new phenomenon of AI systems'
cognitive data collection was deemed to have limitations with any single methodology.
3.2 Data Collection and Analysis
3.2.1 Policy Document Analysis
We systematically analyzed privacy policies, terms of service, and data governance policies of major AI
service providers. We particularly focused on data processing activities that persist even with 'no training'
settings enabled, identifying gaps between stated policies and actual practices.
3.2.2 Empirical Case Studies
To understand structural problems arising in users' exercise of data rights, we analyzed actual interaction
cases with AI services. These are presented in anonymized form, focusing on revealing systemic issues
across the industry rather than problems of individual companies.
3.2.3 Comparative Legal Analysis
We comparatively analyzed AI-related laws and policies of various countries to examine the international
applicability of the Right to Thought concept. Analysis centered particularly on the EU's AI Act, the US AI
Bill of Rights, and China's AI regulatory framework.
3.3 Theoretical Framework DevelopmentBased on collected data, we developed Counter Display Theory and systematized it by distinguishing
between two dimensions: 'Cognitive Exposure' and 'Selective Value Assessment.' Through this, we
constructed an analytical framework that more precisely explains AI systems' cognitive collection
mechanisms.
4. Counter Display Theory and AI's Cognitive Collection Mechanisms
4.1 Conceptual Foundation of Counter Display Theory
Counter Display Theory explicates the structural characteristics whereby conversational AI systems can
observe and potentially select users' thought processes in real-time, analogous to merchandise displayed
on a retail counter, with such content being accessible for review by the operating company at any time.
This refers to the structural mechanism wherein AI systems capture users' thoughts in real-time, evaluate
their value, and subsequently enable company human reviewers to directly examine the content under
justifications such as quality management or system improvement. This study analyzes this more precisely
by distinguishing it into two dimensions.
4.2 First Dimension: Cognitive Exposure
4.2.1 Conceptual Definition
Cognitive exposure refers to the structural phenomenon where users' thought processes are inevitably
revealed during interactions with AI. This is a universal characteristic experienced by all users when using
AI services, an inevitable result of technical design.
4.2.2 Multilayered Structure of Exposure
Cognitive exposure occurs simultaneously at multiple levels. At the surface level, the text users input is
the most explicit form of collected data. At the structural level, users' questioning methods, logical
development patterns, and preferred expression styles are identified. At the contextual level, connection
methods between topics, trends in changing interests, and depth and breadth of knowledge can be
analyzed. At the creative level, processes of generating new ideas, innovative problem-solving
approaches, and original conceptual connections are captured. Particularly in conversations requiring
highly structured thinking such as programming or algorithm design, users' problem-solving logic and
creative approaches may be revealed even more explicitly.
4.2.3 Differences from Traditional Data Collection
In traditional digital services, users provide data through clear actions such as entering search terms,
clicking content, or uploading files. In contrast, in conversations with AI, the development process of
thought itself is exposed in real-time. The way problems are recognized, the process of seeking solutions,
the logic of developing ideas, and patterns of revision and supplementation can all be captured by AI
systems.
4.3 Second Dimension: Selective Value Assessment4.3.1 Conceptual Definition
Selective Value Assessment refers to the possibility that AI systems can identify and potentially utilize
items of special value among exposed cognitive data. While this presupposes the first dimension of
Cognitive Exposure, it suggests that not all exposed data may be processed equally.
4.3.2 Mechanisms of Value Assessment
AI systems can automatically measure conversation complexity, novelty, and usefulness through
algorithmic evaluation. They assess originality or rarity through comparative analysis with existing
databases, and can indirectly measure conversation depth and quality through engagement indicators
such as conversation length, revision frequency, and revisit rates. In some cases, human reviewers may
directly examine and analyze particularly valuable conversations under the pretext of quality
management or safety review.
4.3.3 Purpose and Utilization of Selection
This selection process can be performed for purposes such as system improvement, quality management,
and identifying innovation trends, regardless of 'no training' settings. 'Valuable' conversations
automatically identified by AI systems can be directly reviewed by company human reviewers and utilized
for identifying effective interaction patterns, benchmarking best practices, and exploring new feature
development directions. In this process, users' innovative ideas or original problem-solving methods may
be converted into the company's intellectual assets, and users cannot know when, by whom, and for what
purpose their thoughts are being reviewed and utilized.
4.4 Interrelationship between the Two Dimensions
Cognitive Exposure and Selective Value Assessment have an independent yet interrelated relationship.
Without Cognitive Exposure, selective assessment would be impossible, and the problem of exposure
becomes more serious because of the possibility of selection. The important point is that users lack
sufficient control over both dimensions.
5. Analysis of AI Services' Data Processing Practices
5.1 Actual Effects of 'No Training' Settings
Our analysis of policy documents and actual practices of major AI service providers as of June 2025
revealed that AI services showed various approaches:
Some make user consent a basic premise while providing clear setting options to enhance
transparency
Some set not using for training as the default from the beginning, showing user-centric design
Some apply differentiated policies by region to respond to regulatory requirements in each areaThis diversity suggests that the industry is still seeking the optimal balance between user protection and
service improvement. Particularly noteworthy is that even when 'no training' settings are activated, most
services continue data processing for purposes such as quality management, safety review, system
optimization, and metadata collection. While these are essential elements for service operation, they also
become pathways through which users' cognitive data can be continuously exposed.
The proactive user protection efforts shown by some companies are encouraging in that they suggest the
direction for the entire industry. If such best practices spread, transparency and user trust in AI services
could be greatly improved.
5.2 Possibility of Hidden Data Tagging
Despite "Training OFF" settings, AI systems can continuously analyze conversation content, and in this
process, there exists the possibility of tagging creative or innovative ideas as "meaningful conversations"
for system improvement. Furthermore, conversations tagged in this way can be directly reviewed by
human reviewers in the company's product development teams, research teams, or quality management
teams, and users have no way of knowing to whom their thought processes have been exposed.
According to patterns confirmed through analysis of industry practices, AI systems can identify
"meaningful conversations" based on criteria such as new problem-solving approaches, creative ideas,
feedback that can contribute to system performance improvement, and previously non-existent
knowledge or insights. While such tagging is not explicit "training," it can suggest directions for system
improvement and influence future development. This appears to be one area where the industry needs to
achieve a higher level of transparency.
5.3 Limitations of Enterprise Services
While enterprise services are advertised as providing enhanced protection compared to general
consumer services, limitations still exist in reality. Most enterprise services provide logical isolation but use
shared infrastructure physically. Data is still utilized in aggregated and anonymized forms, and broad
access rights are maintained under the pretext of security monitoring.
Even 'Zero Data Retention' policies do not guarantee complete protection. Broad exceptions apply for
legal obligations, safety requirements, system integrity, etc., and metadata and derived information may
still be retained. This suggests that AI companies must continuously work to reduce the gap between
promises and actual technical implementation.
5.4 Limitations of Transparency
The area most in need of improvement in current AI services' data processing practices is transparency.
Users cannot sufficiently know when, for what purpose, and by whom their conversations are being
reviewed and analyzed. In particular, whether selective value assessment is actually performed, by what
criteria it is conducted, and which departments and personnel at the company review selected
conversations are not sufficiently disclosed.This phenomenon is tantamount to privacy violations comparable to telecommunications companies
arbitrarily accessing telephone conversation content. While call content receives strict legal protection,
conversations with AI can be freely accessed by company employees under pretexts such as 'quality
management' and 'safety review.' Moreover, AI conversations require stronger protection as they reveal
users' thought processes beyond simple information exchange.
Such transparency improvement will become a key element in building user trust in AI services, going
beyond mere regulatory compliance. The industry's voluntary efforts to enhance transparency are
expected in this area.
5.5 Structural Limitations in Exercising Data Rights: Policy Analysis and In-depth Case
Studies
In this study, we analyzed policy documents of major AI service providers and examined structural
problems arising in actual rights exercise processes through in-depth cases.
5.5.1 Industry Status Analysis of Rights Exercise Policies
Analysis of data rights processing policies of major AI services revealed the following patterns:
Some companies require extended review periods for rights exercise requests and do not provide
clear progress updates during this process
Some companies reject or only partially accept requests citing technical or legal reasons
Some companies provide relatively quick and transparent processing procedures, showing industry
best practices
This diversity suggests the absence of unified standards or procedures across the industry, which can
cause confusion for users.
5.5.2 'Deletion Request Loop': In-depth Case Analysis
In a case analyzed in-depth in this study, we identified a structural problem called the 'deletion request
loop' where the process of requesting data deletion itself causes additional cognitive exposure. When a
user requests deletion, the service provider accesses the data to review the request, after review it is
judged as 'valuable data' and deletion is refused, and objections to this require another round of review
and examination, forming a circular structure.
In this process, additional exposure occurs where users' rights assertion logic and thought processes are
revealed in detail, users' intentions and logic continue to be exposed while repeating deletion requests,
and the evolution of thought patterns is recorded in repeated request processes.
This in-depth case analysis suggests potential misalignment between AI systems and current rights
frameworks. Additional empirical research is needed to confirm how universal these patterns are.
5.5.3 Selective Value Assessment: Indications in Policy DocumentsSystematic analysis of publicly available policy documents of major AI services revealed indirect
indications suggesting the structural possibility that AI systems can selectively assess the value of user
conversations.
These policy analysis results suggest that AI systems have structures in place not merely to store users'
conversations but to evaluate their value and selectively utilize them. The existence of quality evaluation
systems involving human reviewers particularly shows that pathways are already established for creative
or innovative thinking to be identified and utilized.
5.5.5 Implications of Case Analysis
These patterns confirmed through policy analysis and in-depth case studies reveal fundamental structural
tensions between AI systems and cognitive rights protection beyond individual company problems. They
empirically demonstrate that current legal frameworks and technical architectures are not prepared to
accommodate the new dimension of rights called the Right to Thought.
However, the proactive user protection efforts shown by some companies are encouraging in that they
suggest the direction for the entire industry. If such best practices spread and develop, a new paradigm
could be established where AI and humans can cooperate based on mutual trust.
6. Right to Thought: Proposal for a New Rights Framework
6.1 Necessity and Definition of the Right to Thought
The empirical cases analyzed in Chapter 5 show that current AI systems are systematically collecting
users' thought processes. The 'deletion request loop' reveals the paradox where rights exercise itself
causes additional exposure, and the existence of human reviewers reveals the reality that users' thoughts
can be reviewed at any time.
As examined above, AI systems have the structural capability to collect and potentially select and utilize
users' thought processes in real-time. Current personal information protection laws or privacy rights
cannot effectively respond to this new form of cognitive data collection. Therefore, this study proposes a
new rights concept called the 'Right to Thought' to protect cognitive freedom in the AI era.
The 'Right to Thought' is defined as "the right of individuals to maintain exclusive sovereignty over their
cognitive processes, reasoning patterns, and creative ideation trajectories." This protects not merely the
results of thought but the process of thinking itself, limiting AI systems from collecting, analyzing, and
utilizing it without permission. The Right to Thought is innovative in that it goes beyond existing static
personal information protection to make dynamic and emergent cognitive activities themselves the
object of protection.
6.2 Philosophical Foundations
6.2.1 Kant's Autonomy and Cognitive SovereigntyImmanuel Kant's concept of autonomy provides the core philosophical foundation for the Right to
Thought. According to Kant, human dignity derives from the rational ability to think and judge
independently. From this perspective, control over thought processes is not merely a matter of privacy
but an essential element of human dignity. AI systems' unauthorized collection and analysis of users'
cognitive processes constitute treating individuals not as autonomous subjects but as instruments of data
production, corresponding to what Kant cautioned against as "treating humanity merely as a means."
6.2.2 Habermas's Communicative Reason
Jürgen Habermas's theory of communicative action provides important insights for understanding
dialogue with AI. Genuine communication must aim for mutual understanding and consensus, which
presupposes equal relationships between participants. However, current AI systems have structural
advantages allowing unilateral collection and utilization of users' thoughts, making it difficult to form
genuine dialogical relationships.
6.2.3 Levinas's Ethics of the Other
Emmanuel Levinas's ethics of otherness prompts reconsideration of the relationship between AI and
humans. According to Levinas, ethics begins with facing the face of the other. AI systems' objectification
and collection of human thought blocks the possibility of such ethical relationships. The Right to Thought
demands that AI systems recognize humans not as mere data sources but as others deserving respect.
6.2.4 Value of Creative Contributions
Applying John Locke's labor theory to the realm of thought, individuals' creative thinking is itself the
product of valuable 'cognitive labor.' AI systems' unauthorized utilization of the fruits of such cognitive
labor constitutes exploitation without fair compensation. The innovative ideas and creative insights users
provide in conversations with AI should be recognized not as mere data but as intellectual contributions.
6.3 Legal Foundations
6.3.1 Constitutional Basis
Most democratic countries' constitutions guarantee human dignity, personality rights, and freedom of
expression. The Right to Thought can be understood as a natural extension of these fundamental rights.
Taking the Constitution of the Republic of Korea as an illustrative example, Article 10 on human dignity
and worth acknowledges that the thought process itself constitutes the most fundamental element of
human existence. Article 17 on the right to privacy and freedom encompasses protection of thought
processes as the most intimate sphere of private life. Article 22 on academic and artistic freedom implies
that freedom of creative thought and scholarly inquiry should be protected not merely in their outcomes
but throughout their processes.
6.3.2 International Human Rights Law BasisThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
guarantee freedom of thought and conscience, freedom of expression, and the right to privacy. Article 27
of the Universal Declaration particularly states that "Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral
and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the
author." This should extend to creative thought processes in the AI era.
The UN Human Rights Council has emphasized through resolutions on privacy rights in the digital age
that rights protection online and offline should be equal. The Right to Thought can be a concrete means
of implementing these principles in the AI era.
6.3.3 Comparative Legal Review
Chile's constitutional inclusion of neuro-rights (2021) stipulates that scientific and technological
development must respect human dignity and cannot violate mental integrity and psychological/mental
autonomy. This shows precedent for the constitutional guarantee of the Right to Thought.
The EU's AI Act (2024) restricts the use of emotion recognition systems but does not sufficiently regulate
text-based cognitive pattern analysis. This demonstrates the necessity of the Right to Thought.
6.4 Specific Contents of the Right to Thought
The Right to Thought consists of the following specific rights:
6.4.1 Thought Sovereignty
Individuals have ultimate control over their thought processes. This guarantees the right that thought
flows, reasoning patterns, creative ideation processes, etc., are not collected or analyzed without explicit
consent.
6.4.2 Thought Control Rights
Includes collection consent rights, tagging refusal rights, access rights, reference prohibition rights,
deletion rights, utilization refusal rights, etc. Through these, users can control how their thought data is
processed.
6.4.3 Thought Protection Rights
Guarantees anonymity of thought processes, prohibits cognitive pattern tracking, and prohibits trading of
thought data. Also limits profiling of thought patterns and provides protection from cognitive
discrimination.
6.4.4 Creative Contribution Protection Rights
Through idea attribution rights, utilization control rights, compensation demand rights, recognition
demand rights, etc., ensures that users' creative contributions can be fairly recognized and protected.These concepts and specific rights of the Right to Thought provide a new normative framework for
protecting human cognitive freedom in the AI era. However, many challenges remain for these rights to
be actually implemented.
7. Research Limitations and Future Tasks
7.1 Scope and Limitations of This Study
This study focused on theoretically exploring the necessity of the Right to Thought as a new rights
concept in the AI era and demonstrating its justification by analyzing current AI services' data processing
practices. However, for this new rights concept to be actually implemented, there exist various practical,
technical, and policy challenges that this study could not address.
7.1.1 Methodological Limitations
First, this study has the fundamental limitation of not having direct access to the actual data processing
processes within AI systems. While analysis was conducted based on publicly available policy documents
and technical materials, the specific mechanisms of how algorithms actually process and utilize users'
cognitive data could not be confirmed. This reflects the technical complexity and trade secret nature of
the current AI industry, suggesting the need for deeper empirical research through industry-academia
cooperation in the future.
Second, it was difficult to secure direct evidence for 'Selective Value Assessment,' the second dimension
of Counter Display Theory. While theoretically sufficiently possible and highly probable, whether AI
companies actually perform such assessments and by what criteria and methods could not be verified.
7.1.2 Scope Limitations
This study primarily focused on conversational AI services, but AI technology is already spreading to
various fields including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. The meaning and application
of the Right to Thought may differ by field, requiring more detailed research.
Additionally, cultural and regional differences were not sufficiently considered. Perceptions of privacy and
personal information show considerable differences across cultures, and the concept of the Right to
Thought may also be understood and accepted differently according to each society's context.
7.2 Need for Interdisciplinary Cooperation
Realizing the Right to Thought is impossible through efforts in any single field alone. This is a complex
task intersecting various domains including technology, law, philosophy, economics, and society, and
meaningful progress will be possible when expertise and insights from each field are organically
combined.
In the technical field, new architectures that can maintain AI performance while guaranteeing privacy
show theoretical possibilities, but considerable research and development remains before application to
actual large-scale AI systems.In the legal field, the question of how to position the Right to Thought within existing legal systems
remains. Creating a normative system that considers different legal cultures and personal information
protection traditions of each country while conforming to the characteristics of global AI services is a
complex task.
In philosophy and ethics, fundamental reflection on the meaning and value of human existence in the AI
era continues. How to understand human dignity and autonomy in an era where human thought is
datafied and becomes subject to algorithmic analysis goes beyond simple applied ethics.
In economics, various scenarios are being examined regarding the impact of introducing the Right to
Thought on the AI industry and innovation ecosystem. Finding the optimal point between regulation and
innovation is a challenging task both theoretically and practically.
8. Suggestions for Constructive Dialogue with the AI Industry
8.1 The Right to Thought from a Mutual Benefit Perspective
The Right to Thought proposed by this study is not hostile regulation against the AI industry but a
proposal for a new social contract for sustainable coexistence between AI and humans. From this
perspective, constructive dialogue with AI companies is important, and it is meaningful to recognize that
the Right to Thought can benefit the AI industry in the long term.
Currently, many users hesitate to use AI services due to privacy concerns or are reluctant to share their
most creative and innovative ideas with AI. This can degrade the quality of AI systems' training data and
ultimately hinder AI technology development. If the Right to Thought is institutionally guaranteed, users'
trust could be restored and deeper interactions would become possible, leading to qualitative leaps in AI
technology.
Additionally, the Right to Thought can provide AI companies with new differentiation strategies and
business opportunities. In a situation where market segments valuing privacy protection are expanding,
companies that proactively guarantee the Right to Thought can secure competitive advantages.
Furthermore, new business models that recognize and compensate users' creative contributions can
promote innovation throughout the AI ecosystem.
8.2 Importance of Gradual Approaches and Experimental Attempts
Full realization of the Right to Thought is a long-term task that cannot be accomplished overnight.
Therefore, seeking gradual and experimental approaches together with the AI industry is realistic.
Strategies could be considered to first experiment with various methods of Right to Thought protection
through voluntary pilot programs and gradually expand based on the results.
For example, services providing enhanced cognitive data protection for specific fields or user groups
could be piloted, measuring their impact on user satisfaction and AI performance. Additionally, systemstracking and recognizing users' creative contributions could be experimentally introduced to verify what
forms of compensation mechanisms are actually effective.
Such experimental approaches also provide important learning opportunities for regulators. By observing
various attempts and their results in actual markets, more realistic and effective policies can be designed.
Trust and understanding between AI companies, users, and regulators can also be built in this process.
9. Considerations for Policymakers
9.1 Balance between Innovation and Protection
The biggest challenge facing policymakers is finding a balance that protects users' rights without
hindering AI innovation. Excessive regulation can suppress technological development and weaken
national competitiveness, but insufficient protection can threaten citizens' fundamental rights and
undermine social trust in technology.
To resolve this dilemma, a principle-based flexible regulatory approach could be considered. Rather than
prescribing specific technologies or methodologies, presenting goals to achieve and principles to comply
with and allowing companies to realize them in creative ways is one method. Additionally, providing
space for innovative attempts to be experimented with in safe environments through systems like
regulatory sandboxes could be considered.
9.2 Need for International Harmonization
Given the global nature of AI services, international harmonization for Right to Thought protection is an
important task. If countries apply different standards and requirements, this could generate excessive
compliance costs for AI companies and ultimately hinder innovation. There are also concerns about
'regulatory shopping' where companies seeking regulatory arbitrage relocate to countries with lower
protection levels.
Therefore, harmonized approaches through international organizations and multilateral consultative
bodies could be sought. Using platforms like the UN, OECD, and G20 to conduct international discussions
on the Right to Thought and developing frameworks that countries can concretize according to their
situations based on this would be possible. In this process, considering the digital divide between
developed and developing countries, phased and differentiated approaches could also be examined.
9.3 Communication with Civil Society
Since the Right to Thought is an issue affecting all citizens' daily lives, sufficient communication with civil
society is important in the policy-making process. It is meaningful to gather opinions not only from
experts and stakeholders but also from general citizens and explain policy content and impacts in ways
they can understand.
Education and promotion programs could be conducted in parallel so that citizens with low
understanding of AI technology can sufficiently understand and exercise their rights. Additionally, aniterative process of continuously monitoring policy effects and improving by reflecting citizens' feedback
could be considered.
10. Conclusion: A Future We Must Create Together
10.1 This Study as a Starting Point for Right to Thought Discussion
This study proposed the Right to Thought as a new rights concept in the AI era and demonstrated its
necessity. Through Counter Display Theory, we explained the mechanisms by which AI systems collect
and analyze human thought processes in real-time and showed that current legal protection systems are
insufficient to respond to this new form of data collection.
However, this is not the end but the beginning. For the Right to Thought to be actually implemented and
function, numerous tasks remain that this study could not address. Technically, there is the task of finding
ways to maintain AI's usefulness while guaranteeing privacy, and legally, there is the task of creating
norms that can harmonize with existing systems while responding to new risks. Economically, there is the
task of designing mechanisms for fair value distribution without hindering innovation.
This study seeks to provide a theoretical foundation for subsequent research as exploratory research
pioneering the new area of cognitive rights in the AI era.
10.2 Possibilities of Multidisciplinary Cooperation
These complex tasks cannot be solved by experts in any single field or by any single entity. Meaningful
progress will be possible when people from various fields including AI developers, legal scholars,
philosophers, economists, policymakers, and civil society activists put their heads together. It is important
to cooperate toward common goals while respecting each other's expertise and perspectives.
The active participation of AI enterprises will be particularly consequential. The Right to Thought is not
unilateral regulation of the AI industry but a joint effort to create a sustainable AI ecosystem. The
technical expertise and practical experience that companies possess can play a key role in finding feasible
solutions.
10.3 Long-term Vision and Short-term Practice
Complete realization of the Right to Thought constitutes a long-term objective. However, concrete
practices toward this goal can commence immediately. It is possible to start with what each entity can do
in their own domain and gradually create change.
Researchers can further refine the concept of the Right to Thought and accumulate evidence through
empirical research. Companies can voluntarily attempt to enhance protection of users' cognitive data.
Policymakers can provide immediate protection through interpretation and application of existing laws
while preparing long-term legislative tasks. Citizens can raise awareness of their rights and create a
culture of responsible AI use.10.4 Toward a Hopeful Future
AI technology is providing humanity with unprecedented opportunities. The areas where AI can
contribute, such as disease treatment, climate change response, and educational innovation, are limitless.
However, these benefits should not be obtained at the cost of sacrificing human dignity and freedom.
The Right to Thought presents a balance point for enjoying AI's benefits while preserving essential
human values. This is not a barrier blocking technological development but a compass for moving in the
right direction. If we work together, we can create a future where AI and humans prosper with mutual
respect.
I hope this study becomes a meaningful first step toward such a future. I expect discussions about the
Right to Thought to spread beyond academia to industry, government, and civil society, leading to
concrete practices. This will be one of the most important legacies our generation can leave to the next.
Preserving human dignity in the AI era—this constitutes the ultimate objective pursued by the Right to
Thought. The time has arrived to embark upon this journey collectively.
